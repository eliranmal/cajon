# cajon

<sup>_CAD designs for a DYI cajon ("box drum")_</sup>


### overview

this design is based on a scale drawing by Joe Cruz [<sup>\[PDF 📥\]</sup>][1], with some modifications made:

- 🎛️ add a knob for tightening/loosening the snare
- 🥁 use two 40-strand snare wires (instead of the standard single 20-strand), for extra crisp!
- 🕳️ make an interesting, asymmetric sound hole (instead of a boring round one)
- 🪑 customize the height to fit my personal ergonomics
- 🪵 adjust dimensions to meet the constraints of my available wood stock


### design constraints

- 📏 any continuous solids must not exceed the available plywood board dimensions: 300x600x6 millimeters
- 🧰 it must be buildable without the aid of power tools (a power drill is ok..)
