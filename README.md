# cajon &nbsp; <sub><sub><sup><sup>_CAD designs for a DIY box drum_</sup></sup></sub></sub>


## overview

this design is based on a scale drawing by Joe Cruz [<sup>\[PDF 📥\]</sup>][1], with some modifications made:

- 🎛️ add a knob for tightening/loosening the snare
- 🥁 use two 40-strand snare wires (instead of the standard single 20-strand), for extra crisp!
- 🕳️ make an interesting, asymmetric sound hole (instead of a boring round one)
- 🪑 customize the height to fit my personal ergonomics
- 🪵 adjust dimensions to meet the constraints of my available wood stock
- 📪 round (fillet) the top side edges, for a slick look and more comfortable sit


## design constraints

- 🧰 must be buildable without the aid of power tools (a power drill is ok..)
- 📏 any continuous solids must not exceed the available plywood board dimensions (_300 x 600 x 6 mm_), the implications:
  - the box top, bottom and sides would have to be laminated from two layers (the upside: no rabate joints to make)
  - as the box width cannot exceed the board width, its depth will have to be adapted to keep the rectangular proportions of the top-view (it's tempting to make the front/back and the sides the same width, but perfect squares may be less desireable as they will produce more standing waves)
