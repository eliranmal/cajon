# cajon


CAD designs for a DYI cajon ("box drum").

based on a scale drawing [<sup>\[PDF download 📥\]</sup>][1] by Joe Cruz, with some modifications made:

- 🎛️ add a knob, for tightening/loosening the snare
- 🥁 use two 40-strand snare wires (instead of one 20-strand), for extra crisp!
- 🕳️ make an interesting, asymmetric sound hole (instead of a boring round one)
- 🪑 customize the height to fit my personal ergonomics
- 🪵 adjust dimensions to meet the constraints of my current wood stock
